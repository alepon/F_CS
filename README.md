For each movie, compute the number of cast members
How many movies do not have a homepage?
For each year, how many movies do not have a homepage?
Extract the domain of each homepage.
Extract a set of normalized tables. That is, each entry of a normalized table must contain exactly one value (not a list or a dictionary).
For each movie, compute the gross margin (difference between revenue and budget)
For each movie, compute the number of crew members
For each movie, compute the number of directors
For each language, compute the number of movies where such language is spoken.
For each company and each decade, compute the overall revenue
For each decade, compute the company with maximum revenue
In each year, how many movies have revenue smaller than the budget?
